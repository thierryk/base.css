/**
 * base.css | v0.6 (04252011) | Thierry Koblentz
 *
 * The purpose of this styles sheet is to set default styles for common browsers and address common issues (missing scrollbar, extended buttons in IE, gap below images, etc.)
 *
 * See the readme file for links to the original article
 *
 * Changes in  v0.6 (04252011):
 *    - swaped text-bottom for bottom and vice-versa for checkboxes and radio buttons (duh!)
 *
 * Changes in  v0.5 (03302011):
 *    - zeroing out line-height on sup and sub to avoid messing up with vertical space between lines
 *    - font and text-transform set to "inherit" for input, button, textarea, select, optgroup and option
 *    - background-color for select to fix a bug (inheritance) in webkit/mac
 *
 * Changes in  v0.4 (06132010):
 *    - input, button, textarea, select, optgroup, option {line-height: 1.4 !important;} (to override FF's default styling)
 *    - styling <ol> inside <ul> (merci Goulven)
